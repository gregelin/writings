<div class="title-text">Introduction</div>
		<div class="body-text">
		Over my past two and half years experimenting with how to leverage technology, I've seen the following patterns among our own work at Sunlight and that or our grantees and peers. For readability, I've kept my notes short. More deserves to be said about each pattern. These patterns were identified for creating transparency, but they apply where ever social organizing applies.
<p />
The patterns are also resource determined rather than goal determined. In other words, if you are journalist and do not know how to program you can pursue the Aggregation pattern because it is inexpensive and requires research and editorial skills more than anything else. For Sunlight and other organizations, these patterns represent one way to conceptually organize their program portfolio and more realistically asses outcomes of investements. Each patterns suggests particular level of investment and type of impact. For example, Model Services offer the potential for very concrete change (e.g. outright government adoption), but also require specific skills to undertake.

<div class="title-text">Model Services</div>
		<div class="body-text">
<b>What:</b> Create an operational version of desired service<br />
<b>Works by:</b> Unleashes new demand, appeals to under-served populations, sets expectations gov't must adhere<br />
<b>Examples:</b> EDGAR, FedSpending.gov<br />
<b>Who:</b> Alpha geeks and domain experts (talent lowers costs)<br />
<b>When:</b> Data is mostly available; nascent/competitive advantage exists; sufficient financing available for robust service; sufficient courage<br />
</div>

<div class="title-text">Aggregation</div>
		<div class="body-text">
<b>What:</b> Conveniently organize previously dispersed information in one place<br />
<b>Works by:</b> Aggregates interests, shows patterns, reveals needs, gathering spot for previously dispersed parties, convenience<br />
<b>Examples:</b> Programmableweb, Techcrunch, FarmSubsidy.org, Taxpayers.net, POGO, EWG Farm Subidy Database<br />
<b>Who:</b> Journalist, domain expert, interested party. Alpha geek helpful, but not required.<br />
<b>When:</b> Editorial expertise and/or technical expertise; minimal financial resources<br />
</div>

<div class="title-text">Open Deliverable Collaboration</div>
		<div class="body-text">
<b>What:</b> Gather virtually or face-to-face group of interested doers<br />
<b>Works by:</b> Weaving social network, building trust, humanizing parties, enables back-channels, safe place for insiders/officials, opens communication channels<br />
<b>Examples:</b> ODOG, The Open House Project, IETF, Earmarks<br />
<b>Who:</b> Baried parties and skill sets, collaborators, skilled facilitator, shared interests, multiple venues (e.g., audience reach)<br />
<b>When:</b> Meaningful deliverable or milestone exists, time-delimited exercise, value in connecting<br />
</div>

<div class="title-text">Repetitive Storytelling</div>
		<div class="body-text">
<b>What:</b> Similar to aggregation, but more focus on inter-daily coverage providing actionable information or revealing opportunities<br />
<b>Works by:</b> Authority building, attention economy, ice-breaker ("Did you see..."). aggregates interests, leads to quoting, creates acceptance and expectations<br />
<b>Examples:</b> Techcrunch, SunlightFoundation, Cool Site of the Day<br />
<b>Who:</b> Storyteller<br />
<b>When:</b> Emerging trend, inadequate coverage, minimal financial resources, daily time<br />
</div>

<div class="title-text">Visualization / Presentation</div>
		<div class="body-text">
<b>What:</b> Creation of meaningful visualization(s)<br />
<b>Works by:</b> Establishing a reference point, memorable and associative, word of mouth. Best get used in testimony and press.<br />
<b>Examples:</b> Valdis Krebs what they read, Earmarks on maps, Enron flows, Many Eyes Gonzales testimony, GoogleZon<br />
<b>Who:</b> One or more of the following talented designer, insightful thinker, creative domain expert<br />
<b>When:</b> talent available, idea, patience<br />
